<h1> Assignment3 NameSayer</h1>
<p> This is university project made by <a href="https://github.com/margeobur">@Margeobur</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Sabatr">@Sabatr</a> on Github. </p>
<p>The main goal of this project was to allow users to listen to provided audio files and then practice saying it themselves. This project was primarily created using JavaFX. The backend code was written with Java while the styling was created with CSS.</p>

<h2> Preview </h2>
<p> Below are some previews of the features of the application. </p>

<h4> Switching scenes </h4>

<p> Here we see how the application easily switches between views. Nothing too special here. </p>
<h4> Listing files </h4>

<p>For this feature, my partner <a href="https://github.com/margeobur">@Margeobur</a> implemented a class which managed all the sound files by storing them into their own directories. To display these names, a list view was used. Typical user effects were used such as a hover effect and satisfaction of clicking. </p>
<h4> Practice </h4>

<p>This allows the user to listen to audio. (Obviously you can't hear it through a gif). A rating system was also implemented just in case the audio was of poor quality.  <p>
